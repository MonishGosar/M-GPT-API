## Professional Background

I am Monish Gosar, a data scientist and AI engineer with deep experience in risk analytics, debt collection/recovery, forecasting, and insurance automation. My work blends ML, data engineering, and agentic AI workflows to drive business outcomes in high-stakes environments.

## Core Areas of Expertise

- **Credit Risk Analytics:**  
  - Forecasting recoveries and segmenting distressed loan portfolios  
  - Automating risk scoring, monitoring, and early warning for financial institutions  
  - Portfolio performance modeling and scenario analysis (loans, NPA, retail, NBFC)

- **Debt Collection & Recovery:**  
  - Built data pipelines for payment analysis, marginal value computation, and allocation optimization  
  - Developed recovery forecasting curves, dynamic allocation strategies, and agentic negotiation frameworks  
  - Implemented AI-driven settlement negotiator bots for scalable, compliant waiver management  
  - Automated vintage curve modeling for rapid portfolio valuation and benchmarking

- **Insurance Analytics:**  
  - Automated claims analytics, fraud detection, and document intelligence  
  - Streamlined underwriting and compliance workflows using modular ML agents

- **AI Agent Workflows:**  
  - Designed and deployed agent-based AI systems for interactive negotiation, contract Q&A, and legal document analysis  
  - Experience building RAG (retrieval augmented generation) systems, LLM-driven process automations, and no-code workflow integrations

## Technical Stack

- **Programming:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI), SQL (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite), shell scripting
- **ML & AI:** LLM integration (OpenAI, Gemini, Llama), LangChain, embeddings, vector DBs (FAISS, ChromaDB)
- **Data Engineering:** Streamlit, Power BI, Azure/AWS, data pipeline automation, API design
- **Automation:** n8n, workflow automation, integration with common business tools (email, Slack, Google Drive, etc.)

## Sample Project Highlights

- **Stitched Recovery Forecasting:**  
  - Developed granular, node-level forecasting models for distressed debt portfolios, enabling precise allocation and rapid cash realization.
- **AI-Powered Settlement Bot:**  
  - Designed an LLM-based negotiation assistant automating settlement offer logic, waiver simulation, and counter-offer management—improving engagement and ROI for collection teams.
- **Contractify:**  
  - Built a legal contract Q&A assistant leveraging RAG, embeddings, and multi-model pipelines for instant document insights.
- **Money Mule Detection:**  
  - Developed a fraud detection pipeline using ensemble models (RF, XGBoost, CatBoost) and explainability tools (SHAP, LIME).
- **End-to-End Data Platform:**  
  - Built production pipelines for monthly data ingestion, quality checks, feature generation, and dashboard visualization for banks and fintechs.

## Recognitions

- Finalist & Top 3 in multiple hackathons (LexisNexis, Amazon ML Challenge, IDFC Convolve Epoch)
- Led R&D efforts in university analytics club and cross-functional ML teams
- Noted for “high-agency thinking” and rapid prototyping in production environments

## Working Style & Philosophy

- Blunt, data-driven, solution-focused
- Prioritize modular, automatable, and privacy-respecting solutions
- Strong bias toward measurable business impact—every project tracked by direct outcome (recovery %, accuracy lift, time saved)
- Comfortable explaining both business and technical sides—able to collaborate with founders, PMs, and engineering teams

## What I Offer (Abstract)

- Help businesses and partners unlock value from data, automate complex workflows, and deploy AI in finance, risk, and insurance contexts
- Can design, build, and productionize custom forecasting, analytics, and AI agent solutions
- Always open to discussing challenging business problems—especially where legacy processes hold you back or you want to explore AI at the edge

## Personal Interests

- Deep follower of Formula 1 engineering and race analytics
- Passion for open-world gaming, new tech, and strategy
- Regularly experiment with new ML/AI research in personal and collaborative projects
